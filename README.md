**Title:** Sex-specific effects of in utero exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances on placental development


**Description:** This repository contains R files for analyzing 151 human placental samples, which include DNA methylation profiles and quantifiable PFAS data. We utilized the R package Planet to predict gestational age (GA) and five placental cell types. Linear regression models were applied, with gestational age acceleration (GAA) and the predicted cell types as the dependent variables, while individual cell types served as the independent variables. Additionally, we assessed the relationship between these variables using quantile g-computation and a mixture analysis model to evaluate the effects of overall PFAS burden on the dependent variables of interest. The results of this analysis are published in Environmental Research: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2025.120868
